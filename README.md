## About the Project

This project showcases how to set up a Next.js application and integrate it with OpenAI's API. The goal is to create a dynamic and responsive web application that leverages AI functionalities, such as natural language processing and content generation.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **OpenAI API** - A set of tools provided by OpenAI to integrate AI models and functionalities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm or yarn
- An API key from OpenAI

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-openai-practice.git
   cd nextjs-openai-practice
  
### Install dependencies:

Using npm:

  ```bash
  npm install
 ```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn install
```
Set up environment variables:
```bash
Create a .env.local file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

env
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

Running the Application
To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or

```bash
yarn dev
```

 The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

Usage
Once the application is running, you can explore various features that demonstrate the integration of Next.js and OpenAI. The UI will provide options to interact with the AI, such as generating text or answering questions.
